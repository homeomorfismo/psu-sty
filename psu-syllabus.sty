	\section*{PSU Policies, Norms, and Resources}

	\subsection*{Academic Integrity}
	Academic integrity is a vital part of the educational experience at PSU. The Student
	Code of Conduct is the university’s policy on academic dishonesty. A confirmed
	violation of that code in this course may result in failure of the course.

	\subsection*{Equity and Inclusion Statement}
	PSU values diversity and inclusion; we are committed to fostering mutual respect
	and full participation for all students. My goal is to create a learning
	environment that is accessible, equitable, inclusive, and welcoming. If any
	aspects of instruction or course design result in barriers to your inclusion
	or learning, please notify me.

	\subsection*{Land Acknowledgement Statement}
	Portland State University is located in the heart of downtown Portland, Oregon
	in Multnomah County. We honor the Indigenous people whose traditional and ancestral
	homelands we stand on, the Multnomah, Kathlamet, Clackamas, Tumwater, Watlala
	bands of the Chinook, the Tualatin Kalapuya and many other indigenous nations of
	the Columbia River. It is important to acknowledge the ancestors of this place
	and to recognize that we are here because of the sacrifices forced upon them. In
	remembering these communities, we honor their legacy, their lives, and their
	descendants.

	\subsection*{Student Services}

	\subsubsection*{Disability Access Statement}
	If you have, or think you may have, a disability that may affect your work in this
	class and feel you need accommodations, contact the Disability Resource Center
	to schedule an appointment and initiate a conversation about reasonable
	accommodations. The DRC is at 116 Smith Memorial Student Union, 1825 SW
	Broadway; 503-725-4150; \href{mailto:drc@pdx.edu}{drc@pdx.edu}.

	\subsubsection*{Student Food Security}
	Any student who has difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient
	food to eat every day, or who lacks a safe and stable place to live, and
	believes this may affect their performance in the course, is urged to contact the
	Committee for Improving Student Food Security for support at
    \href{mailto:foodhelp@pdx.edu}{foodhelp@pdx.edu}.
	Please notify me for additional support if you feel comfortable doing so.

	\subsubsection*{Understanding Sexual Misconduct}
	PSU desires to create a safe campus. As part of that mission, PSU requires all
	students to take the Understanding Sexual Misconduct and Resources learning
	module. If you or someone you know has been harassed or assaulted, you can
	find the appropriate resources on PSU’s Sexual Misconduct Response website.

	\subsubsection*{Title IX Reporting}
	Students frequently come to me for assistance in matters not related to the
	course material. Please be aware that PSU’s policies require instructors to report
	any instance of sexual harassment, sexual and relationship violence and/or
	other forms of prohibited discrimination to university officials, who will keep
	the information private. If you would rather share information about these
	matters with a PSU staff member who does not have these reporting
	responsibilities and can keep the information confidential, please use these campus
	resources:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Confidential Advocates: 503-894-7982 or schedule online (for matters regarding
			sexual harassment and sexual and relationship violence)

		\item Center for Student Health and Counseling: 1880 SW 6th Avenue \#200;
			503-725-2800
	\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection*{Discrimination and Bias Incidents}
	The Office of Equity and Compliance (OEC) addresses complaints of discrimination,
	discriminatory Harassment, and sexual harassment against employees (faculty
	and staff). If you or someone you know believes they have been discriminated
	against, you may file a complaint. Someone from the OEC will contact you to
	discuss how to best address your complaint. The Bias Review Team (BRT) gathers
	information on bias incidents that happen on and around campus, and gives
	resources and support to individuals who experience them. You can report a bias
	incident you experienced or learned about. A member of the BRT will contact
	you if you indicate you would like to be contacted.

	\subsubsection*{Religious Accommodations}
	If you would like to obtain religious accommodations, such as flexibility in attending
	evening courses or extension on assignments, please contact your instructors. If
	you need additional assistance, please contact the Office of the Dean of
	Student Life (DOSL) by emailing \href{mailto:askdos@pdx.edu}{askdos@pdx.edu}.

	\subsubsection*{Cultural Resource Centers}
	Cultural Resource Centers (CRCs) create a student-centered inclusive
	environment that enriches the university experience. They honor diversity,
	explore social justice issues, celebrate cultural traditions, and foster
	student identities, success, and leadership. They provide opportunities for student
	leadership, employment, and volunteering; student resources such as computer
	labs, event, lounge, and study spaces; and extensive programming. All are welcome!

	\subsubsection*{The Center for Student Health \& Counseling (SHAC)}

	medical, counseling, dental, and health promotion services to all PSU students
	taking 5+ credit hours, regardless of the type of insurance coverage. Office visits
	at SHAC are FREE! Students taking 1+ credit hours can access SHAC Dental Services.

	Medical Excuse Notes: The Center for Student Health and Counseling (SHAC) does
	not provide medical excuse notes for absences from classes, labs, studios or
	exams, or for missed deadlines due to short-term illness, injury, or other clinical
	appointments. Visit the SHAC Medical Excuse Policy at
